# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

Pewlet Hackard is a very large company that has been around for many years.  Many of their employees have been with them for many years, and are approaching the age of retirement.  To help the company prepare for a possible large group retiring, we were asked to gather information on this group and help the compnay find people who may be willing to participate in a mentoring program as those positions are filled.  

## Results

1. There are 72,458 employees who were born between 1952 and 1955 that are still working for Pewlet Hackard and are eligible for retirement.  Some of these employees have had multiple titles, which is why the data in retirement_titles is much longer than the total of the counts in retiring_titles.
