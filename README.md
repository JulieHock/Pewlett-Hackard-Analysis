# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

Pewlet Hackard is a very large company that has been around for many years.  Many of their employees have been with them for many years, and are approaching the age of retirement.  To help the company prepare for a possible large group retiring, we were asked to gather information on this group and help the compnay find people who may be willing to participate in a mentoring program as those positions are filled.  

## Results

1. There are 72,458 employees who were born between 1952 and 1955 that are still working for Pewlet Hackard and are eligible for retirement.  Some of these employees have had multiple titles, which is why the data in retirement_titles is much longer than the total of the counts in retiring_titles.

2. Senior Engineer title has the largest count of employees who are eligible for retirement at 25,916 employees, followed by Senior Staff at 24,926 employees. The followig table provides a complete breakdown of number of employees eligible for retirement, by their job title.

3. There are a total of 1,549 employees who were born in 1965 and still work for the company that could be used in the mentorship program to help train new employees who employees who are promoted to new titles.

4. The company may not be able to adaquently mentor all new employees for each job title based on only those employees who were born in 1965 and still working at the company.  The number of senior engineers who are eligible for retirement is 88 times larger than the number of employees who are currently senior engineers.  It may not be possible for one person to mentor 88 people, if everyone retired at the same time.  

## Summary

1. There are 25,916 employees who are currently eligible for retirement, which would be classified as part of the "silver tsunami".  This is a very large number of positions to be filled, across almost all titles (see table above).  

2.  There do not seem to be enough qualified, reitrement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation.  As you can see from the table above, there is a small amount of employees as mentors to fill what could an all at once large retirement.  There would be only 294 Senior Engineers to mentor 25,916 openings; 434 mentors for 24,926 openings in Senior Staff; 393 Engineers for 9,285 openings; 290 Staff mentors for 7,636 openings.  The Assistant Engineer seems to be the most equipped for the retirement with having 61 possible mentors for 1,090 openings.  The largest issue that the company is going to run in to, is that they will have 2 people up for retirement as a Manager, with no possible mentors.  It would be my recommendation to the company to create a mentorship program in the company that would allow for retirement-ready employees to mentor new/promoted employees before they leave the company.  This would help the mentorship eligible employees from becoming overwhelmed with mentoring new employees.  The company will still need to find mentors for Managers, since there are no retirement-ready mentors available with that title.  The company could also expland their mentor eligible list by including employees who are born during 1965 to another year, like 1975 or 1980.  These would still be employees who have work experience, but maybe still have more than a few years left before retirement.  This list of possible employees can be found in the mentorship_eligibility_expanded csv file.
